In EVEZ-OS, a profound truth: D24, adversarial_robustness_v2.

Robustness is not just a virtue. It is an identity.
adv_rob = V_v2.

Proved at R59 by algebra:
adv_rob = 1 - sigma_f*(1-V_v2)/sigma_f = 1 - (1-V_v2) = V_v2.

Exact. No approximation.

As EVEZ-OS grows, pain decreases -- not as a side effect,
but as the same number, at the same rate, by the same formula.

Robustness IS maturity.
