# Monetization Options (without breaking platform rules)

This project can be monetized as a *resilience + audit* engine and as a *modding framework*.
Do not market it as “offensive hacking” or “hidden access discovery”; keep it defensive and testbed-based.

---

## 1) Open-core + paid packs (recommended)
**Open core:** spine, validators, probe harness, play engine.  
**Paid:** curated scenario packs + “mods”:
- Network incident packs (DNS/BGP/TLS/CDN) with realistic traces
- Rollback shooter ops packs (auth skew / rollback corrections)
- OS Lab packs (sandbox VM exercises)

Pricing: $10–$40 per pack, bundles, subscriptions.

---

## 2) Hosted SaaS
Offer a hosted “Spine + HUD”:
- Team dashboards
- Multi-vantage probe orchestration
- Audit exports
- SSO, retention, compliance

Pricing: per seat + per probe volume.

---

## 3) Enterprise licensing + support
Sell:
- On-prem deployment
- Custom integrations (Datadog, OpenTelemetry, SIEM)
- Scenario authoring, workshops
- Support SLA

---

## 4) Marketplace for mods
Define a mod manifest format and let creators sell:
- Playthrough generators
- Bias constitutions
- Specialized probes (defensive)
- Visualizers

Take a revenue cut.

---

## 5) Bounties + paid audits
Use the tool to run **defensive readiness audits**:
- “Can your org prove what happened?”
- “Can your team isolate which layer is lying?”
Deliver: spine exports + postmortem.

---

## Platform constraints
- Chat products have ToS; avoid claiming endorsement or automating in ways that violate them.
- Keep the “universal play” layer as **text + JSON**, validated locally.
