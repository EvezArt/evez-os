# Glass Internet Bias Constitution Pack

Drop-in config + code to keep your arena fair and non-degenerate.

What it enforces:
- target scenario distribution across layers/regions/vantage/temporal behavior
- bounded drift via KL + TV + per-axis deviation
- max-entropy selection weights that repair drift automatically
- audit artifacts you can write into your Event Spine
