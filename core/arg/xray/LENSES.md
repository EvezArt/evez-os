# Internet X-Ray Lenses (Diegetic UI Copy)

These are text-only “lenses” that can be rendered in HUD or tutorials.

## DNS Lens — Naming Fracture
Names are not places. Names are *votes* cached with a timer.

## BGP Lens — Reachability Fracture
Paths are politics. The shortest path is often a trap.

## TLS Lens — Identity Court
Identity is a chain of trust plus a clock that loves to drift.

## CDN Lens — Echo Hall
Fast is a lie that becomes reality until finality catches up.

## Backend Lens — Canon Forge
Clients dream. Server judges. Rollback is the price of immediacy.

## Mixed Lens — Impersonation
Public internet faults impersonate backend bugs and vice versa. Compare vantages or be fooled.

## Quantum Lens — Inference
Bits are the rubble after measurement. Your result is a justified claim with provenance, or it is nothing.
