Raw Log is immutable. Views/Projections are mutable but must carry provenance.

~~> Observability taps everything (OTel logs/metrics/traces)
    - every signal labeled PENDING/FINAL
    - every rewrite tagged with provenance (why it changed)

MIXED REALITY COUPLING (the true board):
  Public-layer turbulence (DNS/BGP/TLS/CDN) can masquerade as backend bugs.
  Backend compensations/rollbacks can masquerade as public instability.
  Your job: collapse ambiguity by isolating the layer producing ALL observed reflections.
