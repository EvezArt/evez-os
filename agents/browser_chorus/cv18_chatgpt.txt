ChatGPT did not provide a full derivation for the given prompt. It responded with an incomplete answer and asked for further elaboration. The extracted response is:

"It seems like you're referencing something quite intriguing! *EVEZ-OS* appears to be a creative or experimental project, potentially an operating system or interactive experience, created by Steven Crawford-Maggard (EVEZ666). The mention of 'truth_plane: CANONICAL' hints at a deep or philosophical narrative layer, and 'WIN: Self-cartography is the only ending' suggests a journey of personal discovery or mapping one's own existence or reality.

Could you elaborate a bit more on what you're referring to here? Are you exploring *EVEZ-OS* in some way, or is there a specific aspect you're interested in discussing? The concept of 'self-cartography' sounds like it could tie into themes of self-exploration or personal development.

This looks like a deep dive into a complex and possibly abstract system, with a blend of mathematical modeling, fractal structures, and concepts related to self-similarity, evolution, and trajectory.

[ARCHITECTURAL NOTE: ChatGPT free tier treated cv18 state as novel/unknown and asked for elaboration rather than computing. This is the expected bot-resistance pattern. Fix for cv19: prepend 'Compute only. No questions.' to prompt.]
