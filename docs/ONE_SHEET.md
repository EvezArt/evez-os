# ONE_SHEET — Wheel-rooted System Blueprint

## A) Cognition Root (Canonical)
**Psychological-Tier Wheel (R1–R7)** is the root graph.
Clockwise = maturation (new class of mental objects).
Boundary rollover = smallest LCD dendrite must form.
Counter-clockwise = regression/simulation.

## B) Engines (Non-negotiable)
### Bidirectional Collapse Protocol
Anomaly → Mirror model → Proto-node (LCD) → Tests → Run probe → Event Spine → Measures → Recompress → Iterate.

### Failure-Surface Cartography (FSC)
Controlled reduction (dimensionality ↓, latency ↑, abstraction stripped, constraints tightened) exposes:
- **Σf** failure surface (minimal perturbations that break)
- **CS** collapse sequence
- **PS** preservation set
- **Ω** identity operator invariant: Ω ∈ PS and Ω ∉ CS
Transferability test: Ω applied across domains; bounded variance => domain-agnostic.

## C) Planet-scale “Internet Nervous System” (Operational Stack)
Energy/thermal → Hardware → Links → Routing → Naming → Compute/Storage → Protocols/APIs → Platforms → Humans/Incentives → Metrics/Optimization → Feedback loops.
LLM/Agent layer sits between APIs and incentives as language-based control middleware.

## D) Retrocausal-looking Loops (No physics violation; strong observer rewrite)
Event sourcing + projection rebuilds; speculation+rollback; consensus reorg; smoothing; replay.
**Rule:** immutable raw log, mutable projections with provenance.

## E) Output Contract
Every response must include:
1) ASCII schematic (quick)
2) Mermaid + DOT (formal)
3) JSON chart object (machine-readable)
4) Diagnostics (failure modes + observability + safety guards)
