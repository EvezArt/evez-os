# Meta-Trace

Player-model and narrator are treated as subsystems.

No invention: facts must be backed by `spine/EVENT_SPINE.jsonl`.

`spine/ARG_SPINE.jsonl` is the theatrical overlay; it may dramatize, but it must cite provenance when asserting events.

FSC cycles write Σf and Ω into the spine, and `tools/self_cartography.py` renders them into `docs/SELF_CARTOGRAPHY.mmd`.
