# Wheel ↔ FSC ↔ Game Stack Bridge

- Wheel rings define *perspective capacity* and what kind of anomaly you can compress.
- FSC maps the earliest-collapse zones (Σf) under stress.
- Game infra turns anomalies into measurable telemetry.

## Practical mapping
- R3/R4 failures show up as role mirroring bugs, authoritative desync, and rule conflicts.
- R5+ failures show up as multi-objective reward hacking (ranking/engagement), metric gaming, and narrative lock-in.

## Pipeline
Anomaly -> Controlled Reduction -> Σf/CS/PS -> Ω -> tests -> results -> measures -> next anomaly
