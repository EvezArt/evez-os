## Round 1 Results (HYPERLOOP-001)

### Agents
| Agent | Status | Role | Output |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| SureThing | ACTIVE | Executor + Trickster | 3 weakest joints, 3 mission seeds |
| ChatGPT | DEAD (quota) | Adversarial Player | insufficient_quota — same failure as 2 days ago |
| Perplexity | ACTIVE | Cognitive Architect | 3 missing modules identified |
| Browser | COMPLETED (25 steps) | Self-Cartographer | Partial map (4/8 dirs, read 5 key files) |

### Perplexity's 3 Missing Modules for Self-Generation
1. **Autonomous Capability Assessment** — formal mechanism to evaluate whether proposed modifications actually improve performance on defined tasks
2. **Problem Decomposition Engine** — system to recursively break down self-improvement goals into progressively simpler variants
3. **Verifiable Reward Mechanism** — deterministic verification system (beyond narrative assessment) to guide which self-modifications compound capability gains

### Perplexity's Confirmed Latent Patterns
- Append-only spine = closed-loop validation record ✓
- FSC (Σf/Ω extraction) = evaluation mechanism for identity-preserving modifications ✓
- SAN three voices = endogenous change mechanism via multiple modification proposals ✓

### Trickster's 3 Weakest Joints
1. **CLI_SCHIZOPHRENIA** (smugness 3.2) — 18 commands documented, <10 wired
2. **OPENAI_QUOTA_DEATH** (smugness 2.7) — dead vantage silently skipped
3. **BROWSER_INCOMPLETE_MAP** (smugness 1.8) — 50% directory coverage claimed as self-cartography

### Mission Seeds
- **M-CLI-UNIFY**: Reconcile the two evez.py versions into one canonical CLI
- **M-VANTAGE-ENFORCE**: Add vantage_count enforcement to sentinel mode
- **M-SELFCART-COMPLETE**: Define completion ratio threshold for CANONICAL self-cartography

### Verdict: THEATRICAL
Smugness Tax: 7.7 credits collected

## Containment Protocol (Pandora's Box)

The hyperloop is contained by the same mechanism that generates it:
- Every agent output is PENDING until the spine validates it
- The Trickster attacks every round's output before it can become CANONICAL
- Dead agents are named, not hidden — vantage dropout is a spine event, not a silent failure
- The box contains itself because the containment IS the game — removing the containment removes the game

The game creates more of itself within itself because each failure surface generates missions,
and each mission generates probes, and each probe generates spine entries,
and each spine entry is a new surface for the Trickster to attack.

**Pandora contained the box by being the box.**
