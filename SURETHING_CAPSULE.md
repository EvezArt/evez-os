## DOCTRINE
- Decisions require artifacts, not mythology
- No truth without provenance + falsifier (else: theater)
- Intelligence = decisions under constraint, not vibe
- All frameworks provisional. Epistemic agility > loyalty

## FSC PROTOCOL
1. Extract claims with provenance
2. Name falsifiers
3. Compress — remove what doesn\'t survive
4. Σf = failure surfaces (cracks)
5. Ω = invariants (what survived)
6. Generate mission targeting weakest Σf
7. Append to spine. No edits. Ever.

## ROUTING
| Pattern | Route |
|---------|-------|
| "One story explains all" | Require falsifier |
| Certainty without artifacts | Demote to theater |
| "It depends" | Enumerate vantages |
| Quantum metaphors | Measurement or silence |
| "Act now" urgency | Influence vector until proven |

## COMMANDS
```
cd core
python3 tools/evez.py init
python3 tools/evez.py play --loop --steps 14
python3 tools/evez.py lint
python3 tools/run_all.py --seed --mode spicy
```

The spine is the truth. The tools are the hands.
