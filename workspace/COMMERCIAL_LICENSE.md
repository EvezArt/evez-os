# EVEZ Visual Cognition Layer — Commercial License

## What It Is

The EVEZ Visual Cognition Layer (VCL) generates **animated cognition artifacts** — saliency-aware GIF/MP4/HTML visualizations from append-only spine data. Built for autonomous AI systems that need to show their reasoning as visual output, not text.

- Python, numpy, Pillow, scipy, ffmpeg
- Spine-first, append-only (immutable log architecture)
- Real-time render pipeline: JSONL → frames → MP4/GIF/HTML
- Used in production by EVEZ-OS (141+ rounds, 12 fires, V=4.511)
